<p>wxHaskell is a portable and native GUI library for <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>. The goal of the project
is to provide an industrial strength GUI library for Haskell, but without the burden of developing
(and maintaining) one ourselves. </p>

<p>wxHaskell is therefore built on top of <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a> &ndash; a comprehensive C++ library that is portable across all major GUI platforms; including GTK, Windows, X11, and MacOS X. Furthermore, it is a mature library (in development since 1992) that supports a wide range of widgets with the native look-and-feel, and it has a very active community (ranked among the top 25 most active projects on sourceforge).</p>
</div>

<div class="text">
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Since the core interface is generated
automatically from the <a href="http://elj.sourceforge.net/projects/gui/ewxw/">wxEiffel</a> binding, about 90% of the wxWidgets functionality is already supported, excluding more "exotic" widgets like dockable windows. Most work is currently directed into writing a Haskellized version of the wxWidgets API. The library currently supports Windows, GTK (Linux) and MacOS X.
</p>
