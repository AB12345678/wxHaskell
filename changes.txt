Version 0.7.1
-------------
Not backward compatible changes:
- Added wildcards argument to the "fileSaveDialog" function.
- Removed to call to "buttonSetDefault" in the "defaultButton" 
  property since GTK seems to enlarge the button in that case.

Backward compatible additions:
- Added "changes.txt" file :-)
- Added "HAS_RADIO_MENU_ITEMS" to "isDefined".
- Added support for radio menu items.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed bug that crashed wxHaskell when a tree control had the focus
  and a key was pressed. Thanks to Olivier Spier for sending a fix.
- The "item" attribute of a list control always returned the first
  item and disregarded the parameter. Thanks to Olivier Spier for 
  sending a fix.
