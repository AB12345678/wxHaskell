wxHaskell is a Haskell binding to the portable wxWindows GUI library.
See <http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net> for the latest information.

The WX library is a /middle-level/ Haskell library for writing graphical
user interfaces. It is build on top the WXH library, the core interface
to the wxWindows library. The wxWindows functions are not explained here.
Please look at the original wxWindows documentation at <http://www.wxwindows.org>

All operations of the WX library are within the 'IO' monad and the library
doesn't offer an explicit state model besides mutable variables ('Graphics.UI.WX.Types.Var').
The following example gives a taste of the general flavor. It is a resizeable
GUI that displays a single, centered /Quit/ button. When clicked (or
activated by the keyboard), it closes the window.

> import Graphics.UI.WX
>
> main = start demo
>
> demo :: IO ()
> demo = do f <- frame    [text := "Quit demo"]
>           q <- button f [text := "Quit", on command := close f]
>           set f [layout := margin 10 (floatCentre (widget q))]
